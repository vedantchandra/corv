# corv: Compact Object Radial Velocities

this package contains routines to model the spectra of compact objects (e.g. white dwarfs and M-dwarfs), and estimate their radial velocities. 

NOTE: `corv` returns statistical errors only. There's an additional systematic error in the measurements from the choice of templates. `corv` RVs are generally good to ~12-18 km/s.
    Also, the montreal DA models don't work on this branch right now. Working on it!
