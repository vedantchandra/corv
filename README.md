# corv: Compact Object Radial Velocities

this package contains routines to model the spectra of compact objects (e.g. white dwarfs and M-dwarfs), and estimate their radial velocities. 

Note: `corv` only returns statistical errors. There's an additional systematic error that's not included in the uncertainty returned. Generally, radial velocities are good to ~12-15km/s.
